# KillIgHk
Kill that annoying igfxHK.exe process that is blocking your favorite keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+Shift+LeftArrow for selecting the rest of the word)

See:
https://communities.intel.com/message/237171

I don't see Intel fixing this in the near future so I added this to my startup.

It also loops for a few seconds and retries finding the process since it may not be there yet as soon as this util starts. (I have it set in my Startup).
